** Novice Digital Artisan (Developer/Creator) **

Hi there! I am Paul from the Philippines. Most of my jobs were in the field of customer service & technical support (Although I don't really consider it Tech Support). 
I am interested in Gaming & Web Development, UX/UI, and pretty much everything related to coding.
The path sure is a hell of a ride, and I'm willing to take that first step. Everything in life is a marathon, and damn I'm ready for it 🔥
